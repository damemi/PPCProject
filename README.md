# PPCProject
Final project for Parallel Programming and Computing at RPI

To build on Linux:
Install opencv on system (I just used apt-get on this page: http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html)

Run "make", the makefile includes and links opencv files which may vary on your system due to their install location

Example code from: http://www.cs.iit.edu/~agam/cs512/lect-notes/opencv-intro/opencv-intro.html
